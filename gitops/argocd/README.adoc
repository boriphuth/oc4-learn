* Deployment Strategy
** Using Operator
* Deployment scope
** Central/Single “ArgoCD” instance managing many applications
* Deployment types
** https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/high_availability/[Configure HA:] This runs more containers, and run Redis in HA mode (The HA installation will require at least three different nodes due to pod anti-affinity roles in the specs).
*  Authentication
** OpenShift integrated ? https://www.openshift.com/blog/openshiftauthentication-integration-with-argocd
** RBAC
*** If users are going to interact with ArgoCD via CLI (or other non-UI tooling) an additional RBAC role is required to grant them access to create Application CR
** Metrics (Prom integration)
